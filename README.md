#### üëã Hey I am Enock Mokua üòÑ

##  Welcome to my Github

# ‚≠ê What I know ‚≠ê

I have a strong background in mathematics and physics therefore if i told you I am a data scientist who specialized on ‚≠êData Analysis and ‚≠êMachine Learning I wont be lying, I taught myself the latter. I am proficient at python also thanks to the Internet and Kaggle

# ‚úçÔ∏è What I am learning ‚úçÔ∏è

I am currently a student at [Moringa School](https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwjYyJ_Zquf4AhVs_HcKHWbZAjsYABAAGgJlZg&ae=2&sig=AOD64_2A1g9rpMFvFBOX-BjljP7QXnATFg&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjS7JfZquf4AhV1hP0HHSBwAnoQ0Qx6BAgDEAE) learning software development.


# Why I am Learning what I am Learning

After mastering the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning and creating several models and competting on Kaggle i decided to venture into the world of fullstack development the failure in learning model deployment was the main factor that pushed me to fullstack. I intend to craete web apps embedded by machine learning and deep learing techniques.
